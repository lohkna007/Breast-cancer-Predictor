# Breast-cancer-Predictor
Predicting and classifying between the malignant and benign types of breast cancer using a support vector machine in machine learning with an accuracy of up to 98.8%.

1. first we will load all the neccessary libraries and data set
2. Then we will wrangle some data and will exclude the columns that are not necessary to evaluate or train the model like the ID, Date etc.
3. Then we will train the support vector machine model with approximately 30% of data from the dataset.
4. Finally we will predict or classify between the cancers whether they are maligant or benign using the model we have trained.
